# riceathon - ricing my cinnamon desktop
this repo contains the dotfiles for my submission for #riceathon hack club you ship we ship.

# about
this is my very first rice on a <b> <span style="color:pink"> virtual machine running linux mint </span> </b>. i have always used windows and have never been brave enough to make the switch to linux (despite it being highly recommended by fellow devs) because i don't trust my abilities enough to dualboot my system and might end up breaking something. i only really started working on linux this week and picked mint because i've seen it called beginner-friendly for people who acquanted with windows. 

# customization process
there was a lot of variety in terms of examples of custom rices i saw on the internet (especially on reddit) and finding the one i liked best while also beginner-friendly with easy-to-follow tutorials was pretty difficult so this is what i could come up with (with tears in my eyes) after mixing and matching so many tutorials. the whole entire thing took me 3 days and almost 9 hours in total with setting up the config files, installing any dependencies and reading documentation but i only remembered to track 1 hour on hackatime :// (forgot to use the vscode terminal instead).
<br><br>
i'm very particular about customization though, i like things a certain way and want things to be pretty so im motivated to use it. for example, i was asked to submit an application at school for a competition and my mom ended up getting a call from my teacher since apparently we aren't allowed to use fancy imported fonts and pastel colors for research paper submissions (talk about being a killjoy ðŸ™„). i like nice colors and fonts and spacing and spending hours editing my notion dashboard for absolutely no reason other than that pretty stuff gives me a dopamine rush !!!

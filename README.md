# Riceathon - Ricing my VM (Linux Mint - Cinnamon)
this repo documents the dotfiles for my first ever rice. i only really started working on linux this week and picked mint because i've seen it called beginner-friendly for people who originally use windows (like me). there was a lot of variety in terms of custom rices i saw on the internet (especially on reddit) and finding the one i liked best while also beginner-friendly was pretty difficult but yeah.
